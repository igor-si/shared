#============ grain update
--friction
we may change them only if we work with clothes (we can decrease these parms)

1) with colliders
2) with particles 

scale kinetic 
1) the powew how strong particles will push each other
2) when higher "scale kinetic" when more strong/sturdy sand would be.

mass shock
1) makes particles ligher depends on how far particles fly


constraint iterations
1) according to ammount of particles. when we have more particles, we need more 
constraint iterations.

velocity blend
1) decrease if we want to get mor stong feedbak from grain
