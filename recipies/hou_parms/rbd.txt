=== bullet soft constraints
"stiffness" is frequency of the spring

in soft constraints sim is not very dependent of the mass of the objects
in spring constraints sim very dependent of the mass of the objects

If we want to get high stiffness, we may
want to increase constraint iterations

if we have a few substeps, solver will have
damping effect without damping

I will never blow up to you and it more
stable then "spring constraint"

== Glue propagation
solver will take impact that occur and when take
the impulse of the collision response and
"record" that as primitive attribute on glue constraints

When impact value goes to be large then "glue strength"
that will cause solver to break the constraint and 
it will let piece move by his one

Is impact value wasn't high enough to break the glue
there "half life" parm come in. It's just a case
for impact value over time.

Half life - is accumulating impact.

Glue impulse needs to spread over network farther away from
the impact location.
That's why "propagation rate" comes in.
It will do number of iteration diffusing spreading impulse
through the network

It it's set "1" it will spread evenly over all neighbours
Iterations controls how far and rapidly the impacts 
will spread.

Prevously number of iteration was the global property of the entire constraint network.
You hat to control this with detail attribute on the constraint
network.

==== collision as spheres
downsides:
if your geo has flat surfaces and hard edges it will be lost
