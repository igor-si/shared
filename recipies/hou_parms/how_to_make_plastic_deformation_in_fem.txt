its really easy to implement in 15, just add a sop solver to update rest if tet deforms too much

each tet has primitive intrinsic attribs measuredarea, perimeter, volume

you can use them to mix your restP and your newrestP

the only catch is you need to transform your deformed tets to initial position in order to get good blends

since restP can be vertex you can update each tet separately from its neighbors

it works really good, i did a few tests w crashing car juts few days ago

and since in 15 fem is so much faster its starting to become usable
