can't install: HTTP exception InvalidCertificateException error #39
Basically, it's an issue with the way some certificates are handled, I fixed it by using curl as the default downloader for package control.

Select Preferences: Package Control Settings - User from the command palette, and add:

// I'm on Linux, so I moved "curl" to the start, but change for your OS.
"downloader_precedence": {
	"linux": [
		"curl",
		"wget",
		"urllib"
	],
	"osx": ["urllib"],
	"windows": ["wininet"]
},
// ...
Select Preferences: Package Control Settings - Default in order to see all the options and their explanations.
