Global Variables
A list of variables available in wrangles. The type indicator isn't needed, but is included as a reminder.

f@Time      //The current time in seconds, equivalent to the $T Hscript variable
i@SimFrame  //The integer simulation timestep number ($SF), only present in DOP contexts.
f@SimTime   //The simulation time in seconds ($ST), only present in DOP contexts.
f@TimeInc   //The timestep currently being used for simulation or playback.

// Available in Attribute Wrangle

Common Geometry Attributes
Frequently used attributes. Houdini knows to cast these to the appropriate VEX datatype.
// Int
@id         // A unique number that remains the same throughout a simulation.

// Float
@pscale     // Particle radius size.  Uniform scale.  Set display particles as 'Discs' to visualize.
@width      // Thickness of curves.  Enable 'Shade Open Curves In Viewport' on the object node to visualize.
@Alpha      // Alpha transparency override.  The viewport uses this to set the alpha of OpenGL geometry.
@Pw         // Spline weight.

// Vector3
@P          // Point position.  Used this to lay out points in 3D space.
@Cd         // Diffuse color override.  The viewport uses this to color OpenGL geometry.
@N          // Surface or curve normal.  Houdini will compute the normal if this attribute does not exist.
@scale      // Vector scale.  Allows directional scaling or stretching (in one direction).
@rest       // Used by procedural patterns and textures to stick on deforming and animated surfaces.
@up         // Up vector.  The up direction for local space, typically (0, 1, 0).
@uv         // UV texture coordinates for this point/vertex.
@v          // Point velocity.  The direction and speed of movement in units per second.

// Vector4
@orient     // The local orientation of the point (represented as a quaternion).
@rot        // Additional rotation to be applied after orient, N, and up attributes.

// String
@name       // A unique name identifying which primitives belong to which piece.  Also used to label volumes.
@instance   // Path of an object node to be instanced at render time.

Specifying VEX Data Types
The following characters are used to cast to the corresponding data type.
float       f@name    // Floating point scalar values.
vector2     u@name    // Two floating point values. Could be used to store 2D positions.
vector3     v@name    // Three floating point values. Usually positions, directions, normals, UVW or colors.
vector4     p@name    // Four floating point values. Usually rotation quaternions, or color and alpha (RGBA).
int         i@name    // Integer values (VEX uses 32 bit integers).
matrix2     2@name    // Four floating point values representing a 2D rotation matrix.
matrix3     3@name    // Nine floating point values representing a 3D rotation matrix or 2D transform matrix.
matrix      4@name    // Sixteen floating point values representing a 3D transform matrix.
string      s@name    // A string of characters.

Channel Shortcut Syntax
This is the syntax used to hint at the data type of auto generated wrangle parameters.
ch('flt1');             // Float
chf('flt2');            // Float
chi('int');             // Integer
chv('vecparm');         // Vector 3
chp('quat');            // Vector 4 / Quaternion
ch3('m3');              // 3x3 Matrix
ch4('m4');              // 4x4 Matrix
chs('str');             // String
chramp('r', x);         // Spline Ramp
vector(chramp('c', x)); // RGB Ramp 


Accessing Attributes on Other Inputs and Nodes
This syntax is used to refer to nodes wired into the inputs of the wrangle, or other nodes in the network.
// 'opinput:X' is the most legible and always works (the first input is input 0).
point('opinput:0', 'P', i@ptnum)
point('opinput:1', 'P', i@ptnum)
point('opinput:2', 'P', i@ptnum)
point('opinput:3', 'P', i@ptnum)

// The integer input number (the first input is 0).  Some functions don't support this but it's easy to type.
point(0, 'P', i@ptnum)
point(1, 'P', i@ptnum)
point(2, 'P', i@ptnum)
point(3, 'P', i@ptnum)

// @OpInputX works as well, but be careful as it isn't 0 based, instead it starts at 1 which is confusing
point(@OpInput1, 'P', i@ptnum)
point(@OpInput2, 'P', i@ptnum)
point(@OpInput3, 'P', i@ptnum)
point(@OpInput4, 'P', i@ptnum)

// v@opinputX_* reads an attribute from the same element on the numbered input (first input is input 0).
v@opinput0_P
v@opinput1_P
v@opinput2_P
v@opinput3_P

// Absolute and relative paths to other nodes look like this.
point('op:/obj/geo1/OUT', 'P', i@ptnum)
point('op:../../OUT', 'P', i@ptnum)


Copying and Instancing Attributes
When copying or instancing, Houdini looks for these point attributes to customize each copy/instance.
p@orient                    // Orientation of the copy.
f@pscale                    // Uniform scale.
v@scale                     // Non-uniform scale.
v@N                         // Normal (+Z axis of the copy, if no p@orient).
v@up                        // Up vector of the copy (+Y axis of the copy, if no p@orient).
v@v                         // Velocity of the copy (motion blur), used as +Z axis if no p@orient or v@N.
p@rot                       // Additional rotation (applied after the orientation attributes above).
v@P                         // Translation of the copy.
v@trans                     // Translation of the copy, in addition to v@P.
v@pivot                     // Local pivot point for the copy.
3@transform or 4@transform  // Transform matrix overriding everything except v@P, v@pivot, and v@trans.
s@shop_materialpath         // The instanced object uses this material.
s@material_override         // A serialized Python dictionary mapping material parameter names to values.
s@instance
s@instancefile              // File path indicating what geometry to instance.
s@instancepath              // Geometry to instance. This is either a path to a file on disk or an op: path.

DOP Wire Attributes
You can create attributes on the wire objectâ€™s RestGeometry to influence its behavior. Most of these attributes allow fine-tuning of the wire by scaling values set in this node. Point, primitive, or detail attributes of the same name will be used if the vertex attributes are not present.
